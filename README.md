# aws-terraform-ec2\_autorecovery

This module creates one or more autorecovery instances.

## Basic Usage

```HCL
module "ar" {
  source = "git@github.com:rackspace-infrastructure-automation/aws-terraform-ec2_autorecovery//?ref=v0.12.18"

  ec2_os          = "amazon2"
  subnets         = module.vpc.private_subnets
  name            = "my_ar_instance"
  security_groups = [module.sg.private_web_security_group_id]
}
```  
Full working references are available at [examples](examples)
**Note** When using an existing EBS snapshot you can not use the encryption variable. The encryption must be set at the snapshot level.\_

## Other TF Modules Used  
Using [aws-terraform-cloudwatch\_alarm](https://github.com/rackspace-infrastructure-automation/aws-terraform-cloudwatch_alarm) to create the following CloudWatch Alarms:
- status\_check\_failed\_system\_alarm\_ticket
- status\_check\_failed\_instance\_alarm\_reboot
- status\_check\_failed\_system\_alarm\_recover
- status\_check\_failed\_instance\_alarm\_ticket
- cpu\_alarm\_high

## Terraform 0.12 upgrade

Several changes were required while adding terraform 0.12 compatibility.  The following changes should  
made when upgrading from a previous release to version 0.12.0 or higher.

### Module variables

The following module variables were updated to better meet current Rackspace style guides:

- `security_group_list` -> `security_groups`
- `resource_name` -> `name`
- `additional_tags` -> `tags`

The following variables are no longer neccessary and were removed

- `additional_ssm_bootstrap_step_count`
- `install_scaleft_agent`

New variable `ssm_bootstrap_list` was added to allow setting the SSM association steps using objects instead of strings, allowing easier linting and formatting of these lines.  The `additional_ssm_bootstrap_list` variable will continue to work, but will be deprecated in a future release.
